Your machine is called Local Host.
There are about 0-65535 ports available in which you can start writing services to host your machine as a server.
There are standard ports which are generalised and are used and known by all, for example tcp uses port 80. Hence these are not available.
And java.net package provides this InetAddress.getLocalHost() method to get our machine's ip address.
