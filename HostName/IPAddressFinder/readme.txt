DNS is nothing but a phonebook.
It contains IP address of the host servers and its host name.
We usually enter url to search on search engines. These urls contain protocals we use, hostname etc.
The hostname in the url is used to identify the server to which we need to establish a connection.
Basically DNS is designed for the ease of remembering character strings rather than integers.
